# pizza-app

Note: The PizzaApp.Core and PizzaApp.Infrastructure projects are not a part of the complete solution.  I wrote those projects as a way to implement Repository and Unit of Work abstraction patterns, but decided that Entity did a good enough job of utilizing those patterns in their framework already.  I kept those projects there in case I wanted to swap out Entity for another data entity that isn't quite as polished.
